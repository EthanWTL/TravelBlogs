The vegetable turlu is also delicious. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on their menu.\n\nAnd definitely have a mixed drink or two. They are yummy.",

I got a Smokey Mountain which had smokey whiskey, amaro, and rosemary among other things. Delightful. We ended up sharing a goat cheese appetizer with perfect bread, lamb meatballs served with a dill yogurt sauce and incredible dumplings called manti. I had never had them before and would definitely get again. I love that the portions are perfectly sized. We didn't have leftovers and we didn't over eat too much. Dessert was a baklava cheesecake.
