       "   'review_text': \"We had dinner here last night for my 35th birthday. It was the right choice!! We started with the de la Manhattan and the Turkish coffee martini (my husband's order - it was delicious but I would have saved it for dessert!) \\nApps were the meze trio - we loved all three but my favorite was the hummus. Then we got a sample of the butternut squash soup from the kitchen - so good! Gently spicy and the pepitas were a nice contrast. \\nFor our main we split the doner kebab, lamb kebab, and the dumplings. Everything was delicious but the doner was an absolute standout. \\nWe were sent home with the baklava cheesecake and it was INCREDIBLE. I will be back just for the cheesecake. \\n\\nThe ambience was cozy, the service was attentive and friendly. Thank you so much Smyrna for an epic celebration!!\",\n",

The food was delicious, our server extremely attentive and helpful, and the ambiance was lively but with the ability to carry on a conversation. Our party ordered many of the well loved items mentioned in previous reviews including the  trio of dips, squash soup, and manti dumplings-it's easy to see why they are popular! We also got the fish stew and vegetable mains. Highly recommend for a tasty meal with great service and atmosphere\",\n",

       "   'review_text': 'We knew the food would be a little out of the ordinary, Smyrna being a Turkish / Mediterranean restaurant, but we weren\\'t expecting stellar, outstanding, never-before dishes. The custom cocktails were interesting and delicious, the curried squash soup was just a little spicy and a brand new combination of flavors and textures. The chicken \"skewers\" were flavorful, tasty medallions of roast chicken with a red (paprika?) sauce that added another layer to the experience. Manti dumplings were tiny and plentiful and well-paired with a sour (yogurt?) sauce. Staying away from the dessert menu was impossible as we\\'d never heard of \"baklava cheesecake\" before and the fortified dessert wines included decent tawny port AND vinsanto. Absolutely delightful staff, carefully-restrained elegant atmosphere, and nowhere near as noisy as other nearby establishments. Highly recommended!',\n",
